This project allows you to get basic information on characters from the game League of Legends using bot telegrams. All information was obtained from the site [League of Spy](https://www.leaguespy.gg/)
# Starting
In order to run the bot, you need:
- Python 3.9+
- Pip3
- Telegram bot api token

> You can get the api token from the BotFather bot in the telegram

To run use these commands:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/stars9t/lolhelper
$ cd lolhelper
$ pip3 install -r reuqirements.txt
```
You should now insert the token into the virtual environment or your bash / zsh.
For example:
```
$ export TELEGRAM_TOKEN="<your token>"
```
After successfully installing the token, you can start the bot:
```
$ python3 main.py
```
